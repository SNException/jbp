CHANGELOG
---------

0.6.0
- Added functionality to generate javadoc (--doc or --no-doc)

0.5.0
- Bugfix: Resources did not copied every 2nd build due to directory being still present
- Additional error messages in case release could not be created
- Now the entire size of your release will be calculated at the end (instead of just the executable)
- When you do not use any libraries corresponding message will be printed

0.4.0
- Now we can specify whether we want to compile our program with or without debug information by using
either '--debug' or '--release' when running the build. When you don't specify any arguments your
program will compile with debug information.

0.3.0
- Resource files are now partially supported (no directory structure yet)

0.2.0
- Bugfix when cleaning directories; removed the deletion of the build directories itself
- Lines of code where not correctly counted due to incorrect line separator
- Way better compile line switches for javac (max amount of errors, no warnings and more detailed error messages)

0.1.0
- Initial release
