CHANGELOG
---------

0.4.0
- Now we can specify whether we want to compile our program with or without debug information by using
either '--debug' or '--release' when running the build. When you don't specify any arguments your
program will compile with debug information.

0.3.0
- Resource files are now partially supported (no directory structure yet)

0.2.0
- Bugfix when cleaning directories; removed the deletion of the build directories itself
- Lines of code where not correctly counted due to incorrect line separator
- Way better compile line switches for javac (max amount of errors, no warnings and more detailed error messages)

0.1.0
- Initial release
