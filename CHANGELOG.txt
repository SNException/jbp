CHANGELOG
---------

0.11.0 (23 December 2020)
- 'RunAfterBuild' now prints the output of the process continuously.

0.10.0 (21 December 2020)
- Added a new setting 'RunAfterBuild' (defaults to 'No'). This is still incomplete because
the output of the program will only be shown after it terminates.

0.9.0 (21 December 2020)
- Removed all previous command line arguments and added '--version' and '--help'
- Implemented jbp.config loading; You can still just execute the jbp.class file and have your
project build, but in case you wish to change the build configuration you can now create
a jbp.config file in your root project directory and change them in there.

0.8.0 (14 December 2020)
- The Java compiler version will now get written to the manifest of the jar

0.7.0 (14 December 2020)
- Compiling now uses fix encoding of UTF-8
- Bugfix: Now we can not specify the same argument twice, or have negating argument sequence like --debug AND --release
- We now check the statuscode of javac to determine whether it was successfull or not. Before we did a String.contains
on the output but that is slower and less accurate.

0.6.0 (13 December 2020)
- Added functionality to generate javadoc (--doc or --no-doc)

0.5.0 (12 December 2020)
- Bugfix: Resources did not copied every 2nd build due to directory being still present
- Additional error messages in case release could not be created
- Now the entire size of your release will be calculated at the end (instead of just the executable)
- When you do not use any libraries corresponding message will be printed

0.4.0 (12 December 2020)
- Now we can specify whether we want to compile our program with or without debug information by using
either '--debug' or '--release' when running the build. When you don't specify any arguments your
program will compile with debug information.

0.3.0 (11 December 2020)
- Resource files are now partially supported (no directory structure yet)

0.2.0 (11 December 2020)
- Bugfix when cleaning directories; removed the deletion of the build directories itself
- Lines of code where not correctly counted due to incorrect line separator
- Way better compile line switches for javac (max amount of errors, no warnings and more detailed error messages)

0.1.0 (11 December 2020)
- Initial release
